	<h1>William Varteresian</h1>
	<h2>A Short Biography</h2>
<div class="block">
	<p>I am an editor and Japanese-to-English translator currently stuying computer science.</p>
	<p>I was born and have spent most of my life in Massachusetts, although I have also lived in Japan on two occasions.</p>
	<p>I take an interest in the history and development of Japanese genre fiction, and particularly in its interactions with the literatures of other cultures. I express this fascination primarily in my translations of Japanese detective fiction from the 1920s and 30s by the influential author Edogawa Rampo.</p>
	<p>In my spare time, I study French and German (mostly to read Maurice Leblanc and Walter Moers) and try to keep my Mandarin from getting too rusty.</p>
