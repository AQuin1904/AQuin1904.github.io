Time spent:  Approximately 5 hours.

Files:
index.html:  Main page with title, portrait image, and links to resume and bio.

resume.html: My resume. Each section, separated by a heading,
             is organized into an unordered list.

bio.html:    An extremely short description of myself.

style.css:   A cascading style sheet for the above three pages.
             It defines a number of classes in addition to general rules,
             but the intended look is minimalist.

index.html:  A simple redirect page stored in my Tufts CS account.
             Contains a link to site in case automatic redirect fails.

Acknowledgments: I consulted w3schools.com for lists of tags, character codes,
                 and color identifiers, as well as instructions on how
                 to set up an automatic redirect link.

Issues:      I succeeded in centering all text, but I was unable to find a way
             to left-justify an unordered list and then center the entire list
             as a block. The allignment CSS tags seem to exclusively override each other.
             I was able to resize the image to my liking (although not to get
             a better picture of myself), but I originally wanted to crop it
             into a diamond using CSS. I was eventually able to find a method
             for doing so online, but I could not replicate the effect without
             simply duplicating the code I'd found, so I settled for using
             simpler CSS features to make it circular.
             I originally considered adding images for books I've translated
             on the bio page, but I decided against it because the cover for
             the second one isn't finished yet, and merely linked
             to the publisher's website instead.
